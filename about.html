          Hi! I’m Daniel original from Germany, came to Berlin in 2008 and
          graduated 2011 in Biotechnology with the main subject brewing
          science at Technical University Berlin.
          After many year’s in the brewing industry I found it’s time for
          something new and I started learning programming by myself.
          This topic was very interesting for me and I liked it very much,
          for this reason I decided to improve my skills by doing a one year
          intensive course learning a more structured way.
          That before I was already working in teams and learning from each
          other helped me a lot to reach my goal to become a Web-Developer
          and also sharing ideas and having fun together I liked a lot.

        <h3>Barman</h3>
        <h6>Head of the Bar stuff until 2005</h6>
        <p>
          Since I came from a family of bar owners I worked many years in
          bars. For this that I like traveling to see new places and learn
          more about other cultures this is the job if you run out of money
          on your way, that started in the 90s when the i-net was at the
          beginning, so I was working all over Europa and ended leading a
          bar for a few years.

        <h3>graduated Brew-master</h3>
        <h6> (still) Head-brewer of Wagenbräu</h6>
        <p>
          2005 got the chance for a apprenticeship as skilled worker in a
          medium size brewery which I finished 2007. Than followed another
          yearn of traveling but this time as a educated brewer.
          2008 I decided to graduate in Biotechnology with the main subject
          brewing science at TU-Berlin which I finished 2011. After this
          really nice 3 years as a student came different jobs in breweries
          mostly Scotland and Germany until I setup my own one called Wagenbräu
          which still produce incredible good craft beers.
